# Akinoccc

Hey! this is Akino, a full stack developer and a passionate open-source enthusiast.

Working at `Uozi`

Maintaining [v-vibe/vue-styled-components](https://github.com/v-vibe/vue-styled-components)

I hope the world becomes better because of open source, and I also hope that the tools I develop can help more people. Bringing various ideas to fruition is the driving force behind my open-source contributions.
